            <h3>Commercial nuclear fusion power</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Nuclear fusion, in its most common form, is the process of energy being released when bits (“atomic nuclei”, if you’re fancy) of hydrogen are exposed to extreme heat and combined. This process releases massive amounts of energy, which humanity is increasingly hungry for. That’s how the sun works too, by the way.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The importance of nuclear fusion lies in earth’s near-unlimited hydrogen supply, which can be extracted from water, and the fact that its only by-product is harmless helium. Fusion reactors are also safer than fission reactors, as they do not create any long-lived radioactive nuclear waste. If implemented, commercial nuclear fusion power would provide cheap utility-scale energy with very little environmental impact and improve energy availability and security.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Several countries have heavily invested in fusion research, and private companies are also conducting their own trials. The ITER reactor, which is under construction in France and due to begin operation in 2026, is the first reactor that should produce energy-positive fusion; but dozens of others are being built.</p>
            <br>
            <p>However, fusion research is slow and capital-intensive. The technology’s biggest issue is that rectors currently need to create temperatures hotter than those found on the sun to start the fusion reaction. Doing so requires more energy than what the reaction produces. Despite recent advances, commercial operation of fusion power is still uncertain and likely more than a decade away.</p>

            <h3>Robot knowledge sharing</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Whether they are in factories, in warehouses, at home, or on the street, robots are impressive… yet profoundly stupid. They work well in highly controlled environments, but every new situation stumps and/or breaks them, which tends to be very expensive. “Robot knowledge sharing” technology changes that. Researchers pushing the concept forward aim to create a standardised way for robots to share information with each other.</p>
            <br>
            <p>That information would be gathered through trial and error (aka reinforcement learning), which we know to be an efficient way for AIs to learn. It could take many forms, from the simple knowledge that an obstacle has appeared on a road, to the ability to grab a complex shape. Efficiency will go up exponentially, and costs will decrease at breakneck speed.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Once the genie is out of the bottle, we will not be able to put it back. But let’s hold the Terminator talks for 2040: hardware, sensors, ML processes, data configuration… much needs to be standardised before the concept works. All the big players will want their way to be the right way, and nothing may get done. At the end of the day, it may be humanity’s inability to agree on anything that saves it.</p>

                <h3>6G</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Just 3 years ago, I was writing about 5G and the numerous industries it would transform: IoT, self-driving, entertainment… and we’re far from being done experimenting with it. And yet, it’s already time to look to the future of internet service: 6G. The good news for me is that 6G’s features are not yet fully agreed on. I can describe what I hope it will be able to do and complain later when I’m inevitably disappointed. In this case, “later” may be a while away: though design and research has already begun, 6G commercialisation won’t be before 2030. This follows the telecom industry’s familiar pattern of adding a new generation every 10 years..</p>
                <br>
                <p>In the meantime, here’s what we do know: the technology will go above and beyond 5G with regards to providing higher peak data rate, lower latency, much more connection density, and energy efficiency. Whether the jump will be as significant as 4G to 5G was is still to be seen, though. Most experts agree that AI will be a key component of the technology, as will secrecy, security, and privacy.</p>
                <br>
                <p>What will be fully different from 5G is the government’s implication in its design: the Korean, Japanese, and American governments already intend to have a say in the future infrastructure of their country. Whether that’s a net positive for privacy is yet to be seen…</p>

            <h3>4D printing</h3>
            <br>
            <p>The name 4D printing can lead to confusion: I am not implying that humanity will be able to create and access another dimension. Put simply, a 4D-printed product is a 3D-printed object which can change properties when a specific stimulus is applied (submerged underwater, heated, shaken, not stirred…). The 4th Dimension is therefore Smart Materials.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The key challenge of this technology is obviously finding the relevant “smart material” for all types of uses (namely a hydrogel or a shape memory polymer for the time being). Some work is being done in this space, but we’re not close to being customer-ready, having yet to master reversible changes of certain materials.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The applications are still being discussed, but some very promising industries include healthcare (pills that activate only if the body reaches a certain temperature), fashion (clothes that become tighter in cold temperatures or shoes that improve grip under wet conditions), and homemaking (furniture that becomes rigid under a certain stimulus). Another cool use case is computational folding, wherein objects larger than printers can be printed as only one part.</p>

                <h3>Generative design AI</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Generative AI technology uses deep learning to generate creative assets such as videos, images, text and music. This technology is no longer new since it entered the mainstream in late 2022. While you may have played with (and enjoyed!) the likes of ChatGPT and Midjourney, they’re barely more than surface-level distractions.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Corporate use for generative AI is far more sophisticated. If used to its full extent, it will reduce product-development life cycle time, design drugs in months instead of years, compose entirely new materials, generate synthetic data, optimise parts design, automate creativity… In fact, experts predict that by 2025, 30% of outbound marketing messages from large organisations will be synthetically generated, and by 2030, a major blockbuster film will be released with 90% of the film generated by AI.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Going beyond the most headline-grabbing use cases, studies have shown that Gen. AI increases productivity for a variety of tasks, with specific benefits for low-ability workers and less experienced employees. Put simply, these tools will level the playing field.

                    This is happening today, and will continue to happen, with increasing success, over the coming decade. That is, if we can navigate the many risks associated with generative AI.</p>
