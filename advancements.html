            <h3>QUANTUM INTERNET</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Building a quantum internet is a key ambition for many countries around the world, such a breakthrough will give them competitive advantage in a promising disruptive technology, and opens a new world of innovations and unlimited possibilities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Recently the US Department of Energy (DoE) published the first blueprint of its kind, laying out a step-by-step strategy to make the quantum internet dream come true,. The main goal is to make it impervious to any cyber hacking. It will “metamorphosize our entire way of life,” says the Department of Energy. Nearly $625 million in federal funding is expected to be allocated to the project. </p>
            <br>
            <p>A quantum internet would be able to transmit large volumes of data across immense distances at a rate that exceeds the speed of light. You can imagine all the applications that can benefit from such speed.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Traditional computer data is coded in either zeros or ones. Quantum information is superimposed in both zeros and ones simultaneously. Academics, researchers and IT professionals will need to create devices for the infrastructure of quantum internet including: quantum routers, repeaters, gateways, hubs, and other quantum tools. A whole new industry will be born based on the idea of quantum internet exists in parallel to the current ecosystem of companies we have in regular internet.

            <h3> GENE EDITING</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Genome editing (also called gene editing) is a group of technologies that give scientists the ability to change an organism's DNA. These technologies allow genetic material to be added, removed, or altered at particular locations in the genome. Several approaches to genome editing have been developed. A well-known one is called CRISPR-Cas9, which is short for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9. The CRISPR-Cas9 system has generated a lot of excitement in the scientific community because it is faster, cheaper, more accurate, and more efficient than other genome editing methods. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>CRISPR-Cas9 was adapted from a naturally occurring genome editing system that bacteria use as an immune defense. When infected with viruses, bacteria capture small pieces of the viruses' DNA and insert them into their own DNA in a particular pattern to create segments known as CRISPR arrays. The CRISPR arrays allow the bacteria to "remember" the viruses (or closely related ones). If the viruses attack again, the bacteria produce RNA segments from the CRISPR arrays that recognize and attach to specific regions of the viruses' DNA. The bacteria then use Cas9 or a similar enzyme to cut the DNA apart, which disables the virus.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Researchers adapted this immune defense system to edit DNA. They create a small piece of RNA with a short "guide" sequence that attaches (binds) to a specific target sequence in a cell's DNA, much like the RNA segments bacteria produce from the CRISPR array. This guide RNA also attaches to the Cas9 enzyme. When introduced into cells, the guide RNA recognizes the intended DNA sequence, and the Cas9 enzyme cuts the DNA at the targeted location, mirroring the process in bacteria. Although Cas9 is the enzyme that is used most often, other enzymes (for example Cpf1) can also be used. Once the DNA is cut, researchers use the cell's own DNA repair machinery to add or delete pieces of genetic material, or to make changes to the DNA by replacing an existing segment with a customized DNA sequence.

                <h3>JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the largest and most powerful space telescope to date. 

                    NASA's infrared space observatory, launched on Dec 25, 2021, from ESA's launch site at Kourou in French Guiana, at 7:20 a.m. EST (1220 GMT; 9:20 a.m. local time in Kourou), aboard an Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket.  </p>
                <br>
                <p>The $10 billion James Webb Telescope is probing the cosmos to uncover the history of the universe from the Big Bang to exoplanet formation and beyond. It is one of NASA's Great Observatories, huge space instruments that include the likes of the Hubble Space Telescope that peer deep into the universe.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It took 30 days for the JWST to travel nearly a million miles (1.5 million kilometers) to its permanent home: Lagrange point 2 — a gravitationally stable location in space. The telescope arrived at L2, the second sun-Earth Lagrange point on Jan. 24, 2022. </p>
                <br>
                <p>L2 is a spot in space near Earth that lies opposite the sun; this orbit allows the telescope to stay in line with Earth as it orbits the sun. It has been a popular spot for several other space telescopes, including the Herschel Space Telescope and the Planck Space Observatory.  </p>

            <h3>First successful transplant of functional cryopreserved rat kidney</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In a groundbreaking new study, the Department of Surgery's Dr. Erik Finger & Joseph Sushil Rao, along with their research team, perform the first successful transplant of a functional cryopreserved rat kidney.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The research, published in Nature Communications, has the potential to save thousands of human lives by enabling long-term storage of organs for transplantation. </p>
            <br>c
            <p>“This is the first time anyone has published a robust protocol for long-term storage, rewarming, and successful transplantation of a functional preserved organ in an animal,” said the study’s co-senior author John Bischof, a mechanical engineering professor and director of the University of Minnesota Institute for Engineering in Medicine. “All of our research over more than a decade and that of our colleagues in the field  has shown that this process should work, then that it could work, but now we’ve shown that it actually does work.” </p>

                <h3>First wiring map of insect brain</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The first wiring map of an insect brain is a connectome of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The connectome was published in Science1 on March 9, 2023.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The connectome is a map of the 3,016 neurons and 548,000 synapses in the brain of a young fruit fly. The brain is smaller than a poppy seed. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The researchers classified the neurons based on how they connected to each other. They identified 93 distinct neuron types. Insects have tiny brains inside their heads and smaller brains called ganglia spread throughout their bodies. Their brains help them see, smell, and sense things faster than humans. This helps them feed and sense danger faster, which can make them hard to kill.
